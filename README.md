# AlphaROC UChicago Project Lab

## Project Description

This repository encompasses three sub-projects aimed at developing analytics based on responses from surveys generated by AlphaROC's Occam product and potentially other alternative financial data sources. These projects involve:

1. **Creating Higher Frequency Macro-Economic Indicators**: This project aims to explore whether survey responses collected on a daily basis within Occam can be used to reconstruct higher frequency (monthly) values of macroeconomic indicators. It involves data analysis and the development of a linear regression framework to achieve this.

2. **Machine Learning Time Series Forecasting Framework**: In this project, we focus on building a systematic infrastructure for comparing and ensembling various machine learning-based forecasting models. It includes the development of a modular time-series forecasting and testing framework and the incorporation of alternative data sources.

3. **Security Price/Macro Indicator Jump-Testing Framework**: This project investigates the use of time-series constructed from alternative data sources to predict the prices of tradable securities, particularly jump events associated with macroeconomic variables.

## Sub-Projects

### 1. Creating Higher Frequency Macro-Economic Indicators

#### Project Overview
- Macroeconomic indicators are crucial for investment decisions, but they are often released at low frequencies (e.g., monthly or quarterly).
- This sub-project aims to reconstruct monthly values of macroeconomic indicators using daily survey responses within Occam.

#### Initial Steps
1. Review survey question data and macroeconomic indicators.
2. Expand the list of macroeconomic indicators.
3. Develop a linear regression framework for reconstruction.
4. Evaluate model performance and consider improvements.

### 2. Machine Learning Time Series Forecasting Framework

#### Project Overview
- This sub-project focuses on creating a modular time-series forecasting and testing framework.
- It includes univariate time-series prediction, feature expansion, and consideration of alternative data sources.

#### Key Goals
1. Develop a modular forecasting and testing framework.
2. Focus on univariate time-series prediction.
3. Incorporate alternative data sources.
4. Identify the best predictors with input from the team.

### 3. Security Price/Macro Indicator Jump-Testing Framework

#### Project Overview
- This sub-project explores the use of time-series data from alternative sources to predict tradable securities' price jumps.
- It aims to develop a framework for detecting predictive relationships and refining it.

#### Steps
1. Utilize internal APIs and databases.
2. Identify events where alt-data predicts actual values.
3. Develop methods for detecting predictive relationships.
4. Refine the framework with confidence measures.
5. Develop trading strategies based on alt-data signals.
