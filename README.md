## Project Description

This repository aims at developing analytics based on responses from surveys generated by user survey websites and potentially other alternative financial data sources. These projects involves building a systematic infrastructure for comparing and ensembling various machine learning-based forecasting models. It includes the development of a modular time-series forecasting and testing framework and the incorporation of alternative data sources.


#### Project Overview
- This project focuses on creating a modular time-series forecasting and testing framework.
- It includes univariate time-series prediction, feature expansion, and consideration of alternative data sources.

#### Key Goals
1. Develop a modular forecasting and testing framework.
2. Focus on univariate time-series prediction.
3. Incorporate alternative data sources.
4. Identify the best predictors with input from the team.



## Structure

1. **imports.py**: Contains all the import statements for the pipeline.
2. **data_processing.py**: Functions for data loading, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
3. **model_training.py**: Functions for training, optimizing, and saving models.
4. **evaluation.py**: Functions for evaluating models and generating reports.
5. **visualization.py**: Functions for visualizing results and creating summary charts.
6. **utils.py**: General-purpose utility functions.
7. **main.py**: The entry point to run the pipeline.

## Usage

1. Install required dependencies by referring to the imports in `imports.py`.
2. Modify the function placeholders in each module as per your requirements.
3. Run `main.py` to execute the pipeline.
